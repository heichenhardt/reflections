*** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the hidden subfolder ".git" which keeps status information and history for the repository.

*** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think it is a good way to collect all the changes you want to commit in a separate area. Because staging is separated from the commit we can add multiple times to staging without creating multiple commits like that.
