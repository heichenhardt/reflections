*** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the hidden subfolder ".git" which keeps status information and history for the repository.

*** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think it is a good way to collect all the changes you want to commit in a separate area. Because staging is separated from the commit we can add multiple times to staging without creating multiple commits like that.

*** How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps to see how a branch diverged from master past a certain point. It is therefore a lot clearer what needs to be done in terms of rebase / merge and what changes are missing in what branch.

*** What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is a commit which has two parents the tip of the coins branch and the tip of the master branch. The resulting commit contains all the commits from master and coins.

*** What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Automatic merging saves you time when to merge is trivial. So whenever the situation is not ambiguis git is merging for us. Only if it is unknown what needs to be done than git is asking us for our input.
